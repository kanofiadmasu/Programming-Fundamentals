# Software Engineering.

Most people most of the time think software engineering is all about writing code in some programming language. Yes, writing code is an essential part of software engineering, but there are other 
essential things constitutes software engineering, without which softwere engineering wouldn't be software engineering.  

***What is the Puorpose of Software Engineering?***

Software Engineering at it's core is to Design, Build, and Maintain a reliable software system that solves real world problem. The main pillar of sotware engineering or the main motive behind building
software is to solve problem. In doing so there are other important things that need to be done.

# The sphere of Software Engineering. 

***1. Problem Analysis and Requirements:***  
This is the first important step in software engineering, it is understanding and observing problem or need.   

***2. Designing solutions:***  
This is the second step where we come up with a solution to the problem and how we can build and structure the solution, it includes the (architecture, databases, APIs, etc...).  

***3. Implementation(Coding):***   
This how we implement our designed solution tailored to our specfic problem. This is what most people think what software engineering is, it is essential-- without it we can't provide solution to our problem, but this is not the only part. 

***4. Testing and Debbuging:***  
Ensuring our solution(Software) is working as expected, and correcting if there is problem with our softare. 

***5. Deployment and Maintainace:***
Releasing our software to our real users and ensuring it is working properly. 


I used to think that software engineering is only writing code and becuase of that I find it hard to truly know what and why I am building. Having the full picture helped to learn software engineering more
and build larger projects efficiently.

This is my own observation and personal experience. If there is anyting to add, improve, or change, give me a comment on X @kanofiadmasu.
