# **Programming-Fundamentals**

## **Daily Learning Journal**

This Repostiory is where I share the foundational programming concepts that I learned every single day. I will post what I learned everyday small or big to track my progress, check and solidfy my understanding and also share what I learned and how I learned things so that other can learn more.  

### I will share 
      1. How I learned important concpets (methods and princples)
      2. What Resources I used 
      3. The projects I built, why I build them, the lesson I learned from those projects and many more. 

***The main learning principles I use to learn any new concept***
      
      1. Pareto Principle: This principle is also known as 80/20 rule, this is a foundational principle that enables you to get the grasp of any new concept in a short amount of time. This principle gives you the prerequisite ideas and concepts you need to go deep and understand a given concept fully. The main empahsis are the 20% input that will return 80% of the output, which is the most important feild. 

      2. Spaced Repetition: 
      3. Active Recall:
      4. Asking-the-right Question principle:
