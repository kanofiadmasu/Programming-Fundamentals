 # JavaScript Main Concept -- OOP.  

### What is object oriented programming in Javascript?

Like in other programming languages, OOP in javascript is also a prgramming paradigm where we orgnize and structue codes in an object. 

### Objects.
*Object Data type*  

An object in javascript is a bit confusing, becuase in javascript there are javascript object data types and instantiated/class objects. 
JS object data type is a data type, where we store data as a key-value pair, where keys are uniqe and made up of strings and symbols, values can be of any data type.
We can compare this data type with other programming language data types, for example JS objects are similar to python dictionaries, or java's Hashmaps. 
So, generally this object data type is data type that stores data in key-value pair. We can create this objects mainly using the object literal {} or using the **new** key word. 

*Using object literal method*  
   ```javascript
   const Person = {
   name : 'x',
   age: 10,
   isadult: False
   };
   ```
*Using using the new keyword*  
 ```javascript
 const Person = new Object({
 name: 'x',
 age: 10,
 isadult: False
 });
```
*Instance Objects*  

This are the objects are a collection of properties and methods. Properties are the data the object has and methods are the behaviour of our objcet. 
We can access properties and objcets using the '.' notation or the '[ ]' notation. One thing to notice is In javascript everything is Object including the object data type 
except non-primitive data types. 

The main way where we create objects is throguh constructors, factories and in modern JS it is using the 'class' keyword. Let us define what each way of creating object differ from one
another.
