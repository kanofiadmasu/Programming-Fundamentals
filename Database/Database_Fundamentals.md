 # Database and DBMS

 *1. What is Database?*  
Databases are orgnizned and structred data that can be easily managed, accessed and updated. 

*2. What are the different database paradiamgs (Data models)?* 
Before answering this what does database paradiamgs or data models mean? DB paradigm is a coceptual structure of the data, the structue in which the data is going to be represented inside the database.

When talking about data models there are different types of data models, these are: 
1. Relational- Where Data is stored in tables, and keys form or define relations.  
2. Document model- Data is represented as a document
3. Key-Value Model - Data is store as a key-value pair
4. Graph Model- Data represented in nodes and edges
5. Object-oriented Model- Data is represented as an object, which has its own attributes and methods
6. Multi Model- A data model that combines different types of models.

Each of this data models has their own use. 

*3. What is a database managment system?*
